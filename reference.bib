human thermal comfort and stress across almost infinite combinations of air and mean radiant temperatures, humidity, air speed, clothing thermal insulation and metabolic rate. The major differences between indoor and outdoor situations is solar and infrared radiation, and these have been included in OUT\_SET* calculations by use of a separate model for estimating outdoor mean radiant temperature. The OUT\_MRT model calculates the uniform surface temperature of a hypothetical enclosure around a standing subject that would exchange the same infared radiation with the subject as allwave radiation in the complex, actual solar and infrared environment. The predictions of absorbed solar radiation by OUT\_MRT are significantly correlated with the observed values for a range of clothing insulations and environmental conditions},

This paper is a proof of concept study via continuous monitoring of the pedestrian level winds and thermal parameters at two sample days in summer, which include instantaneous air temperature, globe temperature, wind speed and humidity. Three outdoor locations at an university campus are chosen and daytime thermal perceptions at the three sites were evaluated using PET (Physiological equivalent temperature). A PET based new index was defined, which is called the thermally-perceivable environmental parameter difference. By analyzing the simultaneous differences of radiant temperature, wind speed and air temperature between the monitored spots, it is shown that it was the wind speed and radiant temperature differences that were making significant differences in thermal comfort. This pilot study clearly indicates that wind amplification combined with shading effects can generate thermally comfortable conditions in the open ground floor beneath an elevated building, even on a sunny, hot summer day in a subtropical city. This finding helps to alert city planners of additional options available in precinct planning to encourage outdoor activities.},

Inadequate human thermal comfort conditions can affect quality of life and the use of public open spaces. In this study, outdoor thermal conditions are examined through three field campaigns in Bilbao in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Climate variables are measured in four different areas of the city in different regional climate conditions. Thermal comfort evaluation is undertaken by means of the thermal index PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature). Measurements are compared with estimated values derived from ENVI-met model. Results show that the differences between modelled and measured climatic variables can imply a relevant deviation in PET (i.e. difference between modelled and measured values). Regression and correlation analyses account for the importance of the deviation of each climatic variable in the deviation of PET values. Deviation of PET appears to be highly conditioned by the deviation of mean radiant temperature values especially during clear sky days. Under overcast conditions deviation of wind speed also becomes a relevant aspect. Consequently, reliable estimation of these variables is required if modelling techniques are to be used in the assessment of thermal comfort in outdoor urban spaces.},

	abstract = {The present paper deals with the dependence of outdoor thermal comfort on the design of an urban street. The effects of the street vertical profile, including asymmetrical canyon shapes, the use of galleries and further shading devices on the façades, arranged in various orientations are assessed. The study is conducted by means of numerical modelling by using the three-dimensional microclimate model ENVI-met 3.0 which prognosticates the microclimatic changes within urban environments. Thermal comfort is evaluated for the daytime hours across the canyon in high spatial resolution and by means of the physiologically equivalent temperature PET.

The results revealed that all design aspects investigated have a moderate impact on the air temperature and a strong effect on the heat gained by a human body and hence on the resulting thermal sensation. The larger the openness to the sky of the canyon, the higher the heat stress. For canyons with a smaller sky view, the orientation is also decisive: E–W canyons are the most stressful and deviating from this orientation ameliorates the thermal conditions. Basically, galleries and further shading through overhanging façades or vegetation enable a sensitive decrease of the period of time and of the area of thermal discomfort. Yet, this efficiency varies with the orientation and the vertical proportions of the canyon. Therefore, if appropriately combined, all investigated design elements can effectively mitigate heat stress in the summer and promote thermal comfort.},

	abstract = {Hong Kong is a high-density sub-tropical city with 7 million people living in an urban area of just over 260 km2. Tall and closely packed buildings are the common urban morphology. How the urban geometry influences the microclimate in summer daytime is a primary planning concern. The sky view factor (SVF) has been commonly used to indicate the impact of urban geometry on air temperature differences in cities. However, only limited discussions in this aspect have been addressed for daytime course in high-rise and high-density urban environment such as Hong Kong. This paper firstly provides a comprehensive review of SVF analysis in urban climatology studies and then presents a simulation approach to investigate the role of SVF in determining summer daytime intra-urban air temperature differences in urban Hong Kong. An ArcGIS-embedded computer program is developed for calculating continuous SVF values for an entire urban environment and an SVF map is generated. The result is evaluated against meteorological data observed in field measurements. The regression analysis shows that the spatial average of SVF values has a close negative relationship with daytime intra-urban temperature differences. The study indicates that SVF is a significant factor for understanding the microthermal climate in Hong Kong's street canyons. The paper further raises discussions on the application of SVF analysis to urban planning. The study demonstrates that the SVF analysis is a useful and effective tool for planners and urban climatologists conducting studies on high-rise and high-density sub-tropical cities. The understanding can provide support for the development of planning standards and good practice. Copyright © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {Surface emissivity is a critical parameter for studying city-, meso-, and micro-scale climate and energy balance. The emissivity of complex surfaces e.g. a forest or an urban canopy is an effective surface property since it depends on both surface materials and geometry. This study presents a novel methodology for estimating effective emissivity using sky view factor retrieved from airborne Lidar data, building GIS data, and land use and land cover classification data. First, a high correlation between the effective emissivity retrieved from ASTER TIR bands 10–14 and the sky view factor was observed (r2 = 0.93, 0.99, 0.99, 0.97, 0.97). When the sky view factor decreases, the effective emissivity tends to increase, which is mainly due to multiple scattering (cavity effect), thus increases the effective emissivity. A simplified model which assumes that reflection and scattering only occurs within a single pixel was developed. Results showed that the correlations between the modeled and the spectral (band) emissivity retrieved from the ASTER multispectral TIR data (five spectral bands) are high (r2 = 0.93, 0.99, 0.98, 0.93, 0.97), and with low RMSE (0.019, 0.016, 0.012, 0.003 and 0.004 from band 10–14 respectively). The emissivity derived from this simplified model, however, tends to be overestimated in band 10–12. Thus, a refined urban emissivity model based on sky view factor (UEM-SVF) which considers the scattering and reflection from adjacent pixels was developed in this study. Results show a good agreement with ASTER spectral (band) emissivity: r2 = 0.90, 0.98, 0.96, 0.94 and 0.96, and very low RMSE (0.006, 0.003, 0.004, 0.002 and 0.004). This study illustrates that the UEM-SVF can be useful for estimation of land surface emissivity of complex surfaces, and can further be used for accurate land surface temperature retrieval.},
