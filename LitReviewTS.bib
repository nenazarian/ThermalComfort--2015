	abstract = {Microclimatic conditions inside urban areas depend on the result of the interaction of the regional climate with the whole urban area and on the local characteristics of the urban development. Inadequate human thermal comfort conditions can affect quality of life and the use of public open spaces. In this study, outdoor thermal conditions are examined through three field campaigns in Bilbao in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Climate variables are measured in four different areas of the city in different regional climate conditions. Thermal comfort evaluation is undertaken by means of the thermal index PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature). Measurements are compared with estimated values derived from ENVI-met model. Results show that the differences between modelled and measured climatic variables can imply a relevant deviation in PET (i.e. difference between modelled and measured values). Regression and correlation analyses account for the importance of the deviation of each climatic variable in the deviation of PET values. Deviation of PET appears to be highly conditioned by the deviation of mean radiant temperature values especially during clear sky days. Under overcast conditions deviation of wind speed also becomes a relevant aspect. Consequently, reliable estimation of these variables is required if modelling techniques are to be used in the assessment of thermal comfort in outdoor urban spaces.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the contribution of street design, i.e. aspect ratio (or height-to-width ratio, H/W) and solar orientation, towards the development of a comfortable microclimate at street level for pedestrians. The investigation is carried out by using the three-dimensional numerical model ENVI-met, which simulates the microclimatic changes within urban environments in a high spatial and temporal resolution. Model calculations are run for a typical summer day in Ghardaia, Algeria (32.40°N, 3.80°E, 469 m a.s.l.), a region characterized by a hot and dry climate. Symmetrical urban canyons, with various height-to-width ratios (i.e. H/W=0.5, 1, 2 and 4) and different solar orientations (i.e. E–W, N–S, NE–SW and NW–SE), have been studied. Special emphasis is placed on a human bio-meteorological assessment of these microclimates by using the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET).

The results show contrasting patterns of thermal comfort between shallow and deep urban streets as well as between the various orientations studied. A comparison of all case studies reveals that the time and period of day during which extreme heat stress occurs, as well as the spatial distribution of PETs at street level, depend strongly on aspect ratio and street orientation. This is crucial since it will directly influence the design choices in relation to street usage, e.g. streets planned exclusively for pedestrian use or including motor traffic, and also the time of frequentation of urban spaces. Both investigated urban factors can mitigate extreme heat stress if appropriately combined. The solar access indoors has been briefly discussed as an additional criterion in designing the street by including winter needs for solar energy.},

	abstract = {The present paper deals with the dependence of outdoor thermal comfort on the design of an urban street. The effects of the street vertical profile, including asymmetrical canyon shapes, the use of galleries and further shading devices on the façades, arranged in various orientations are assessed. The study is conducted by means of numerical modelling by using the three-dimensional microclimate model ENVI-met 3.0 which prognosticates the microclimatic changes within urban environments. Thermal comfort is evaluated for the daytime hours across the canyon in high spatial resolution and by means of the physiologically equivalent temperature PET.

The results revealed that all design aspects investigated have a moderate impact on the air temperature and a strong effect on the heat gained by a human body and hence on the resulting thermal sensation. The larger the openness to the sky of the canyon, the higher the heat stress. For canyons with a smaller sky view, the orientation is also decisive: E–W canyons are the most stressful and deviating from this orientation ameliorates the thermal conditions. Basically, galleries and further shading through overhanging façades or vegetation enable a sensitive decrease of the period of time and of the area of thermal discomfort. Yet, this efficiency varies with the orientation and the vertical proportions of the canyon. Therefore, if appropriately combined, all investigated design elements can effectively mitigate heat stress in the summer and promote thermal comfort.},

	abstract = {Hong Kong is a high-density sub-tropical city with 7 million people living in an urban area of just over 260 km2. Tall and closely packed buildings are the common urban morphology. How the urban geometry influences the microclimate in summer daytime is a primary planning concern. The sky view factor (SVF) has been commonly used to indicate the impact of urban geometry on air temperature differences in cities. However, only limited discussions in this aspect have been addressed for daytime course in high-rise and high-density urban environment such as Hong Kong. This paper firstly provides a comprehensive review of SVF analysis in urban climatology studies and then presents a simulation approach to investigate the role of SVF in determining summer daytime intra-urban air temperature differences in urban Hong Kong. An ArcGIS-embedded computer program is developed for calculating continuous SVF values for an entire urban environment and an SVF map is generated. The result is evaluated against meteorological data observed in field measurements. The regression analysis shows that the spatial average of SVF values has a close negative relationship with daytime intra-urban temperature differences. The study indicates that SVF is a significant factor for understanding the microthermal climate in Hong Kong's street canyons. The paper further raises discussions on the application of SVF analysis to urban planning. The study demonstrates that the SVF analysis is a useful and effective tool for planners and urban climatologists conducting studies on high-rise and high-density sub-tropical cities. The understanding can provide support for the development of planning standards and good practice. Copyright © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {This paper presents the findings of an outdoor thermal comfort study conducted in Hong Kong using longitudinal experiments—an alternative approach to conventional transverse surveys. In a longitudinal experiment, the thermal sensations of a relatively small number of subjects over different environmental conditions are followed and evaluated. This allows an exploration of the effects of changing climatic conditions on thermal sensation, and thus can provide information that is not possible to acquire through the conventional transverse survey. The paper addresses the effects of changing wind and solar radiation conditions on thermal sensation. It examines the use of predicted mean vote (PMV) in the outdoor context and illustrates the use of an alternative thermal index—physiological equivalent temperature (PET). The paper supports the conventional assumption that thermal neutrality corresponds to thermal comfort. Finally, predictive formulas for estimating outdoor thermal sensation are presented as functions of air temperature, wind speed, solar radiation intensity and absolute humidity. According to the formulas, for a person in light clothing sitting under shade on a typical summer day in Hong Kong where the air temperature is about 28°C and relative humidity about 80\%, a wind speed of about 1.6 m/s is needed to achieve neutral thermal sensation.},

In this study, the effects of building layout patterns and trees arrangement on the outdoor wind environment and thermal comfort at the pedestrian level were investigated by using Simulation Platform for Outdoor Thermal Environment (SPOTE). The conclusions were summarized as follows: 1) it has been found that trees arrangement, buildings layout patterns and their orientations with respect to wind have significant effects on the outdoor wind environment and pedestrian level thermal comfort. The long facades of building, which are parallel to the prevailing wind direction, can accelerate horizontal vortex airflow at the edges and obtain pleasant thermal comfort and wind environment at pedestrian level. 2) Configurations that contain a square central space articulated by buildings and oriented toward the prevailing wind can offer better exposure to air currents as a result of attenuated revised standard effective temperature (SET*). Such configurations are regarded as the optimum building layout patterns and trees arrangement.},

We extended the model SOLWEIG, one of the few methods to derive mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) building-resolved and city-wide, to include spatial patterns of meteorological input. Based on a day within an extreme heat event (2003) in Berlin, Germany, we examined the effect of the new method on Tmrt, which uses gridded meteorological input data from a mesoscale weather model, compared to a standard set-up using ungridded data. Results indicted a considerable effect of spatially resolved air temperature (up to 3.2 K) during midnight. Furthermore, we detected high sensitivity of Tmrt to the partitioning of direct and diffuse short-wave radiation. The spatial pattern of Tmrt revealed that at midday the city centre exhibited low values compared to open areas. We conclude that considering meso-scale atmospheric conditions and urban structure for simulating Tmrt city-wide can lead to a more appropriate description of heat-stress hazards and might also be valuable for climate-sensitive urban planning.},

The study models were selected typical flat and tower apartment residential housing in Korea; 54 cases were defined using an orthogonal array table based on experimental design. These cases are analyzed to quantify the outdoor thermal comfort (mean radiation temperature distribution) and heat island potential (HIP) change throughout a day according to several design variables (building type, site planning type, façade direction, and landscape ratio). A three-dimensional numerical simulation of all surface temperatures is performed. The results are analyzed statistically using multivariate analysis of variance. It was quantitatively characterize the effects of the design parameters on the outdoor thermal environment of the apartment housing. An evaluation index of the design parameters is proposed. A designer can apply the proposed index in the design process and in feedback for green apartment housing projects.},

	abstract = {The outdoor environment is deteriorating in many tropical cities due to rapid urbanization. This leads to a number of problems related to health and well-being of humans and also negatively affects social and commercial outdoor activities. The creation of thermally comfortable microclimates in urban environments is therefore very important. This paper discusses the influence of street-canyon geometry on outdoor thermal comfort in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Five sites with different urban geometry, ground cover, and distance from the sea were studied during the warmest season. The environmental parameters affecting thermal comfort, viz. air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, were measured, and the thermal comfort was estimated by calculating the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). The thermal comfort is far above the assumed comfort zone due to the combination of intense solar radiation, high temperatures, and low wind speeds, especially on clear days. The worst conditions were found in wide streets with low-rise buildings and no shade trees. The most comfortable conditions were found in narrow streets with tall buildings, especially if shade trees were present, as well as in areas near the coast where the sea breeze had a positive effect. In order to improve the outdoor comfort in Colombo, it is suggested to allow a more compact urban form with deeper street canyons and to provide additional shade through the use of trees, covered walkways, pedestrian arcades, etc. The opening up of the city’s coastal strip would allow the sea breeze to penetrate further into the city.},

We found a great variety of instruments and methods used to measure meteorological variables, especially with respect to the mean radiant temperature and wind speed. Moreover, many different subjective judgement scales were used to assess subjective thermal perception, thermal neutrality and thermal preference and a multitude of thermal indices were used to quantify the combined effect of meteorological variables on thermal perception. The use of a variety of methods makes it difficult to compare results of the different studies. There is thus a need for standardization and to give guidance regarding how to conduct field surveys in outdoor environments. Such standards and guidelines should give advice regarding the choice of measurement sites, type and positioning of instruments, appropriate methods to determine the mean radiant temperature, questionnaire design and suitable thermal comfort indices. These guidelines should also include advice on reporting.},

Throughout the three numerical simulation experiments and a presupposition of a same total leaf area for all greening cases, the differences of vegetation patterns on the pedestrian thermal comfort have been studied with an evaluation index as (Standard Effective Temperature) SET . Firstly, in comparison with grass and shrub patterns, greening with tree does not always have better effects for improving pedestrian thermal comfort in summer in all directions around buildings. The reasons include the relatively negative function of tree to decrease the wind velocity and the hourly change of the sun's location. However, if considering the average SET around the pedestrian space, greening with tree is still better than others are. Secondly, the difference for the three vegetations for pedestrian comfort is affected by the arrangements and orientation of buildings. Thirdly, there is an optimized pattern with a lower SET distribution for the configuration of trees (including the shapes and arrangements) around buildings. In this situation, the average SET in the pedestrian space has a slight difference and should be carefully compared for better outdoor pedestrian comfort.},

This paper is a proof of concept study via continuous monitoring of the pedestrian level winds and thermal parameters at two sample days in summer, which include instantaneous air temperature, globe temperature, wind speed and humidity. Three outdoor locations at an university campus are chosen and daytime thermal perceptions at the three sites were evaluated using PET (Physiological equivalent temperature). A PET based new index was defined, which is called the thermally-perceivable environmental parameter difference. By analyzing the simultaneous differences of radiant temperature, wind speed and air temperature between the monitored spots, it is shown that it was the wind speed and radiant temperature differences that were making significant differences in thermal comfort. This pilot study clearly indicates that wind amplification combined with shading effects can generate thermally comfortable conditions in the open ground floor beneath an elevated building, even on a sunny, hot summer day in a subtropical city. This finding helps to alert city planners of additional options available in precinct planning to encourage outdoor activities.},

The OUT\_MRT model calculates the uniform surface temperature of a hypothetical enclosure around a standing subject that would exchange the same infared radiation with the subject as allwave radiation in the complex, actual solar and infrared environment.

In the first step, climate change scenarios for air temperature and solar radiation (global, diffuse, direct components) are created using a change-factor algorithm. The change factors are calculated by comparing ranked daily regional climate model outputs for a future-period and a present-day period, and then changes consistent with these daily change factors are applied to historical hourly climate observations. In the second step, the mean-radiant-temperature (T mrt) is calculated using the SOLWEIG (SOlar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) model. T mrt, which describes the radiant heat exchange between a person and their surroundings, is one of the most important meteorologically derived parameters governing human energy balance and outdoor thermal comfort, especially during warm and sunny days. We demonstrate that change factors can be applied independently to maximum air temperature and daily global solar radiation, and show that the outputs from the algorithm, when aggregated to daily values, are consistent with the driving regional climate model. Finally, we demonstrate how to obtain quantitative information from the scenarios regarding the potential impact of climate change on outdoor thermal comfort, by calculating changes in the distribution of hourly summer day-time T mrt and changes in the number of hours with T mrt {\textgreater}55 °C.},

Water evaporation from moist surfaces could potentially reduce the local temperature in urban areas, a process known as evaporative cooling. This paper introduces a coupled model to study the effect of evaporative cooling on the temperature conditions in an urban street canyon. A computational model for determining convective heat and mass exchanges between the canyon walls and the air is proposed. The model couples three sub-models: (i) a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, which solves heat and vapor transfer in the air, (ii) a Building Envelope Heat and Moisture (BE-HAM) transport model which solves heat and moisture transfer within the porous building walls and (iii) a radiation model (RAD) which determines the radiative heat exchange between the surfaces. An efficient coupling strategy has been developed and applied to investigate the drying of a wet windward wall of a street canyon. The effect of evaporation on the reduction of the surface and air temperatures in a street canyon is analyzed and the influence of these temperature reductions on the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) is shown to be important.},

	abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is increasingly being used as a tool for the analysis of outdoor and indoor air flow and thermal conditions. With over half of the world’s population living in cities, rapid population growth and dense urban development has increasingly led to the phenomenon of urban heat islands, which in turn contribute to the deteriorating air quality and thermal discomfort in outdoor urban public spaces. In hot arid countries, changes in the characteristics of the urban microclimate are observed due to dense urbanization, high-rise buildings, and industrialization of the building processes and materials, leading to a reduction in thermal comfort in outdoor and indoor spaces. This research highlights the potential of adopting Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as a simulation technique to investigate the complex fluid flow patterns in urban thermal environments, and investigates methods intended to prolong thermal comfort in public places. It discusses the advantages and limitations of CFD tools and the procedural guidelines for conducting CFD simulation. This paper also gives examples of case studies of CFD assessment for indoor and outdoor urban environments, and the practical use of RANS solver in comparison with LES, DES, and DNS models. Finally the paper highlights a case study of a CFD simulation using a RANS turbulence model of an urban street in the hot arid city of Madinah, Saudi Arabia.},

	abstract = {Outdoor human comfort in an urban climate may be affected by a wide range of parameters, including wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, air quality, human activity, clothing level, age, etc. Several criteria have been developed in the wind engineering community for evaluating only the wind-induced mechanical forces on the human body and the resulting pedestrian comfort and safety. There are significant differences among the criteria used by various countries and institutions to establish threshold values for tolerable and unacceptable wind conditions even if a single parameter, such as the wind speed is used as criterion. These differences range from the speed averaging period (mean or gust) and its probability of exceedance (frequency of occurrence) to the evaluation of its magnitude (experimental or computational). The paper addresses the progress made towards the computational evaluation of pedestrian level winds. All existing criteria for wind and thermal comfort are absolute criteria, which specify the threshold values or comfort ranges for respective weather parameters. The paper will outline an approach towards the establishment of an overall comfort index taking into account, in addition to wind speed, the temperature and relative humidity in the area.},

	abstract = {This study identifies the use of the sky view factor (SVF) in urban climate studies. In addition, it relates air temperature differences to the SVF and examines these differences with respect to the height at which fish-eye photographs are taken for the calculation of the SVF. The study focuses on night-time air temperature patterns within the urban canopy using data collected during clear, calm nights from sixteen permanent stations and from car measurements. Fish-eye photographs taken at two levels (2 m above ground and at ground level) are compared and shown to be statistically different. The results of the study performed in Göteborg, Sweden, indicate a fairly strong relationship between air temperature and SVF. The permanent stations used indicate that it is better to use fish-eye photographs taken at ground level. The relationship is determined by means of regression analysis. The SVF variation in urban areas and the importance of SVF in relation to other central parameters such as thermal admittance are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is one of the most important meteorological parameters governing human energy balance. In this paper, three different methods of obtaining the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting are compared. Method A is based on integral radiation measurements and angular factors, method B is based on measurements with a 38-mm flat grey globe thermometer and in method C makes use of the Rayman 1.2 software is used. Measurements were performed in a large open square in a high latitude city—Göteborg, Sweden—during clear to overcast weather conditions in October 2005 and in July and August 2006.

Results show that the difference between Method A and Method B was generally relatively small. Most of the discrepancy, caused by rapid changes in radiation, temperature and wind speed was smoothed out using 5 min mean values. By systematically and empirically changing the mean convection coefficient, the accuracy of Method B was improved and a new equation expressing the Tmrt was obtained. With this new equation the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer could successfully be used to estimate the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting provided that the wind speed and the air and globe temperatures are measured accurately. The study also shows that the flat grey colour of the globe thermometer slightly underestimates the level of short-wave radiation (i.e. sunshine). Method C works very well during the middle of the day in July, i.e. at high sun elevations. However, the model considerably underestimates the Tmrt in the morning and evening in July and during the whole day in October, i.e. at low sun elevations.

In outdoor urban settings where thermal comfort researchers or urban planners and designers require an easy and reliable method of estimating mean radiant temperature, the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer provides a good and cheap solution.},

	abstract = {Surface emissivity is a critical parameter for studying city-, meso-, and micro-scale climate and energy balance. The emissivity of complex surfaces e.g. a forest or an urban canopy is an effective surface property since it depends on both surface materials and geometry. This study presents a novel methodology for estimating effective emissivity using sky view factor retrieved from airborne Lidar data, building GIS data, and land use and land cover classification data. First, a high correlation between the effective emissivity retrieved from ASTER TIR bands 10–14 and the sky view factor was observed (r2 = 0.93, 0.99, 0.99, 0.97, 0.97). When the sky view factor decreases, the effective emissivity tends to increase, which is mainly due to multiple scattering (cavity effect), thus increases the effective emissivity. A simplified model which assumes that reflection and scattering only occurs within a single pixel was developed. Results showed that the correlations between the modeled and the spectral (band) emissivity retrieved from the ASTER multispectral TIR data (five spectral bands) are high (r2 = 0.93, 0.99, 0.98, 0.93, 0.97), and with low RMSE (0.019, 0.016, 0.012, 0.003 and 0.004 from band 10–14 respectively). The emissivity derived from this simplified model, however, tends to be overestimated in band 10–12. Thus, a refined urban emissivity model based on sky view factor (UEM-SVF) which considers the scattering and reflection from adjacent pixels was developed in this study. Results show a good agreement with ASTER spectral (band) emissivity: r2 = 0.90, 0.98, 0.96, 0.94 and 0.96, and very low RMSE (0.006, 0.003, 0.004, 0.002 and 0.004). This study illustrates that the UEM-SVF can be useful for estimation of land surface emissivity of complex surfaces, and can further be used for accurate land surface temperature retrieval.},

	abstract = {A thermal comfort study has been carried out in outdoor urban spaces in Singapore. The field study was carried out from August 2010 to May 2011. There were 2059 respondents from 13 different outdoor spaces participated in this study and 2036 effective questionnaire responses were collected. Thermal comfort perceptions and preferences were analyzed in this study. The neutral operative temperature occurred at 28.7 °C and preferred temperature was found to be 26.5 °C. Thermal acceptability analysis shows the acceptable operative temperature range was 26.3–31.7 °C in outdoor urban spaces in Singapore. Correlation analysis indicates that sun sensation/solar radiation has the most significant influence on human thermal sensation in outdoor spaces. This study also explores the impact of thermal adaptation on human thermal sensation in outdoor spaces, which could be useful for future researchers. Comparative analysis shows that people may expect a higher temperature in outdoor conditions than in semi-outdoor or indoor conditions in Singapore, suggesting that people in outdoor conditions could be more tolerant with the heat stress than people in indoor conditions in tropical climate.},

	abstract = {Comfort index-based control has become the tendency of the development of new HVAC control systems, while an effective sensor for thermal comfort index is indispensable to a successful comfort index-based HVAC control system. Based on detailed discussions on calculating and measuring the equivalent temperature, predicted mean vote (PMV) and standard effective temperature (SET*), a comfort sensor with a new structure is proposed in this paper. The proposed PMV and SET* measurement instrument consists of an equivalent temperature sensor, a relative humidity sensor and a temperature sensor. By utilizing this sensor we can “measure” the PMV and SET* of an imaginary environment, which is extended from that defined in the concept of the equivalent temperature by Madsen (ASHRAE Transactions 1984;90(1):1077–90). Furthermore, we show that the PMV and SET* of the imaginary environment are almost the same as the actual ones. Simulation results have verified that the suggested PMV and SET* sensor can have a good measurement of PMV, while for SET* more research work is needed to improve the accuracy of its measurement. Most importantly, more practical work, including calibration validation and test of its sensitivity to the variation of environment variables in real conditions, need to be performed.},
